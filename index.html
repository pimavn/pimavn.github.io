            <h2>Projects in Mathematics and Applications</h2>
            <p>PiMA is a non-profit project founded by Mathematics enthusiasts from some of the major universities in the world. We strive for assisting and mentoring students in Vietnam who are curious to learn about Mathematics and its applications. Our main program will be a one-week long summer camp where students can learn applied mathematics and do their own projects under our guidance.</p>
